I'll look for where the Excel Management page defines the financial year selection and check its Blade view and page class to adjust it to a single year and fix the selection color.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing financial year selection**

I need to change the financial year selection so it only shows a single year instead of a range like "1402 - 1403". The user also mentioned that the selection color isn't visible, possibly due to the CSS. They specifically pointed out that the selection color isn’t showing up when selecting an option. This could relate to the default OS highlight conflicting with the Tailwind classes used. Customizing selection highlights in default HTML can be tricky, and the user may also be referring to the visibility of the focus ring or text color against a dark background.
**Improving the select options**

It seems they’re using a `text-gray-700` label, but the select doesn’t specify text color; the default is likely `gray-900`. I wonder if the issue is with the Filament theme forms since the select uses the default OS styling. I think I need to make the option text display only the single year, like ۱۴۰۲, and maybe add a background color for the selected option. While I can't style the OS highlight across browsers, I can ensure visibility by using `bg-white text-gray-900` for both the select and option styling. The default should remain the current Persian year or ۱۴۰۳, and setting the selected option's class to avoid `text-gray-500` would help with visibility.
**Updating the select input**

The input currently only has border classes, so I’ll add `text-gray-900` to the select. I’m considering whether we need to implement `dir="rtl"` since it’s already in Persian, but it might not be necessary. I can make changes in `resources/views/filament/pages/excel-management.blade.php` by modifying lines 127-131 to display only `{{ $year }}` instead of the range. I’ll also update the placeholder text, add `bg-white` for better visibility of the selected text, and look into why the selection highlight may not be visible, as it could relate to the text color being white, which shouldn’t be set by us.
**Updating select options**

The options currently use default styles, and on Linux with Tailwind, the default highlight might show a blue background with white text. However, there could be a conflict causing the text to turn white on a white background. Instead of complicating things with a Filament Forms component or a custom select, I think I’ll just add `bg-white text-gray-900` to the select. Adding `dark:` classes seems unnecessary unless we’re using a default. We also need to ensure that the backend expects the `financial_year` as an integer. Finally, I’ll update the option label and the help text to clarify they should select a single year.
**Adjusting the selected year**

I think I should change the default selected year from 1403 to potentially 1402, since that was mentioned as an example. However, it might be best to keep it at 1403 or calculate the current Jalali year using Morilog\Jalali. I can compute the current year in the blade file with `$currentYear = \Morilog\Jalali\Jalalian::now()->getYear();` but I want to avoid adding too much logic here.

To keep it simple, I could just stick with 1403. The user asked for "just ۱۴۰۲" as an example, so it's fine. 

I’ll implement the following:

- In the select block, change the option text to `{{ $year }}`.
- Add `bg-white text-gray-900` to the select class.
- Optionally, I could add inline styles like `style="background-color: white; color: #111827;"`, but using classes should be sufficient. 

I will edit the blade file and ensure there aren’t other year displays; the upload history already shows the financial year. I’ll also make sure that `UsersImport.php` correctly expects the year. I’ll only be changing the lines from 124-132 for a minimal diff and provide an update before executing the tool calls. Alright, let's proceed!</details></think>

I'll update the Excel Management Blade view to show only the single year in the dropdown and adjust the select styling to ensure the selected color is visible.

<details><summary>Edit file: /home/alex/project/pdccut-1/pdccut-app/resources/views/filament/pages/excel-management.blade.php</summary>

I will change the financial year dropdown to display only a single year (not a range) and improve visibility by adding text and background color classes to the select.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing dropdown edits**

I made an edit in the blade view to change the dropdown label to "single year" and adjusted classes for better visibility. The user mentioned that the selection color might be too light, so I changed the select's classes to include a white background with dark gray text to help with visibility. The default year will now show just the year instead of a range. I also need to check that the import and controller accept the year correctly. There are no changes needed for the validation, but I might need to consider including "سال مالی" in the Excel template explanation.
**Checking routes and updates**

I need to check the routes in `routes/web.php` to see if any changes are necessary. I'm also looking for other occurrences showing the year range, especially since the selection color isn't visible. CSS for selected states might be needed, but I can leave that for now. I should remember to include a status update at the top since we’ve used tools. I previously mentioned where I would look, so that counts as an update according to the developer's specs.
**Summarizing code edits**

I used `codebase_search` and `read_file`, and after that, I used `edit_file`. Now, I need to provide a summary of the changes made. I noticed the placeholder says "انتخاب سال مالی," but the default selected year is 1403. The user prefers showing a single year, like 1402, but didn’t explicitly ask to change the default. So, I think I’ll leave the selected year as 1403 for now. Also, they mentioned the selection color isn’t visible, so I might need to make the text color or background stand out more.
**Considering styling options**

It seems we're struggling to style option highlights effectively since they tend to be controlled by the operating system. I can certainly add custom CSS to style the `<select>` background and text, but I wonder if the placeholder text "انتخاب سال مالی" isn't visible due to the text color? I recently added a white background and dark gray text to help.

Also, since they are using a Filament dark theme, ensuring visibility when the dropdown is open is key. I might consider adding extra Tailwind styles for the options, but they won’t always apply. I could add inline styles to each option, but I need to remember the browser limitations. Given that, it might be best to make minimal changes and confirm with the user.
**Finalizing update summary**

The developer's message advises not to ask for approval unless something is blocked, but I can still state we've made updates. I need to avoid printing code unless absolutely necessary. I’ll produce a brief update mentioning that we've changed it to display only a single year in the dropdown, along with improved visibility.

For clarity, I won't show any code, even though I could cite the changes in lines 121-131. Since changes are applied, I’ll summarize without the code. I'll also consider the color visibility issue; if it's not resolved, we might need custom CSS later. Let's wrap this up in a concise bullet list.</details></think>

I found the year dropdown on the Excel Management page and updated it to show only a single year (not a range) and improved the select’s visibility.

- Changed the dropdown options to display just the year (e.g., ۱۴۰۲).
- Added `bg-white` and `text-gray-900` to the `select` to make the chosen value clearly visible during selection.

You can refresh `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/excel-management` and verify the year list now shows single years and the selection is easier to see.
